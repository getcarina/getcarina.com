*For service discovery and shared configuration, use the etcd distributed key-value store.*

Service registration discovery is the centerpiece in systems that are
both distributed and service-oriented. Pinpointing how nodes in a cluster
can register, discover and determine the necessary services available,
and the means by which they can communicate with said service is the
heart of the problem that service discovery technologies aim to solve.

In an active environment, containers are constantly being commissioned
and decommissioned based on needs, standards, maintenance and failures.
As you scale out your container architecture, keeping track of all the
services in a static manner
is not adequate, and a dynamic means of avoiding disturbance or
disruption to your services is required.

The technologies described below are the current front-runners in the
industry with regard to service registration and service
discovery.

### CoreOS’ etcd

etcd is a distributed key-value store used for service discovery and shared
configuration. It is intended to be a simple implementation of the Raft
consensus algorithm [(1)](#resources), enabling decision-making among a large and unstable number of cluster participants. Within a cluster, etcd's consistency with Raft informs how leaders are nominated and elected and how a leader handles data for the cluster.

Consensus is the process of agreeing on one result among a group of participants. This problem becomes difficult when the participants or their communication medium may experience failures.

etcd configurations are designed to provide consistency and partition tolerance: all nodes see the same data at the same time and operation continues despite partitioning caused by network failures.
etcd chooses consistency over availability. Specifically, etcd implements
sequential consistency based on a quorum of nodes.

Many projects use etcd, including Google's Kubernetes, Pivotal's Cloud
Foundry, Rackspace's Mailgun, Apache's Mesos, and Mesosphere's DCOS [(2)](#resources).

### Apache’s Zookeeper

Zookeeper is a distributed configuration service synchronization service
and naming registry for large distributed systems. ZooKeeper was a
sub-project of Hadoop but is now a top-level project in its own right.

Zookeeper configurations are designed to provide consistency and partition tolerance: all nodes see the same data at the same time and operation continues despite partitioning caused by network failures.
Zookeeper uses the Zookeeper Atomic Broadcast (ZAB) protocol to coordinate changes across the
cluster [(3)](#resources).

Many projects use Zookeeper, including Hadoop’s HBase, Yahoo, and
Rackspace’s Email & Apps.

### Hashicorp’s Consul

Consul is a tool for service discovery and configuration. It is distributed,
highly available, and extremely scalable. Key features include:

- **Service discovery:** Consul makes it simple for services to
  register themselves and to discover other services via DNS or HTTP
  interface. External services such as SaaS providers can be
  registered as well.

- **Health checking:** Health checking enables Consul to quickly
  alert operators about any issues in a cluster. The integration with
  service discovery prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and
  enables service level circuit breakers.

- **Key-value storage:** Flexible key-value store enables
  dynamic configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader
  election and more.

- **Multi-datacenter:** Consul is built to be datacenter-aware
  and can support any number of regions without complex
  configuration [(4)](#resources).

Like etcd, Consul implements the Raft consensus algorithm [(1)](#resources).
Consul configurations are designed to provide consistency, so that all nodes see the same data at the same time, and partition tolerance, which allows operations to continue despite partitioning caused by network failures.

In a limited search, public projects or companies using Consul were not found.

### Comparison and recommendations

Service Discovery is rated as "basic" or "advanced" based on whether the technology has more service monitoring and health-checking capabilities. In this sense, Consul has some advanced features when compared to Zookeeper and etcd.

In terms of which technology to use:

- Zookeeper has been around longer and thus is considered to be mature,
  but its dependency on Java tends to deter many users. It
  is also worth noting that many think that Zookeeper is starting to show some
  age, can be complicated to adapt into cloud infrastructures, and is difficult to work with
  and troubleshoot.

- etcd and Consul are both new to the scene, but etcd is slightly older
  than Consul. The community seems to prefer etcd and uses etcd far more than Consul.

**Current Recommendation:** etcd
