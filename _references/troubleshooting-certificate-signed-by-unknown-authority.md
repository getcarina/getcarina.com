When running a docker command, as shown in the following example, you may receive an error similar to the following:
```bash
$ docker ps -a
An error occurred trying to connect: Get https://256.130.0.42:2376/v1.20/containers/json?all=1: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "crypto/rsa: verification error" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "serial:11002205957147154644")
```

This error occurs when the credentials you are using on your local machine do not match the credentials expected by the cluster.

## Resolution
Download and use the credentials generated by and assigned to the cluster in question.
