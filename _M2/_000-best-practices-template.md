*Begin with a very short summary statement of the main recommendation that will be supported by the rest of the article; write this after you write the "Comparison and recommendations" section, to ensure that they match. Italicize the summary to emphasize it is not the article itself.*

<!--
Follow the summary with an introduction. Don't call it "Introduction" or anything else; that is, do not precede it with a heading. Define what questions you are answering here; set expectations for what can be learned by reading on. This is not a tutorial; it is a source of advice. What is the benefit of following this advice?

This is not a tutorial, but it is meant to teach. If a tutorial is like a lab class, with students learning by doing, a best-practices article is like a lecture class, with students learning by listening to an expert's explanations and observations. You can introduce a best-practices article like you would introduce a class syllabus, by identifying what you expect students to learn from their time with you.
-->

Several tools are available to enable *x*. You can choose the best tool for your application by *y*. Using the best tool will help you to *z*.

### Option 1

<!--
Explain first and spend the most space on the option that you will later identify as recommended. This isn't objective journalism, in which it's important to provide equal time to all candidates. This is teaching, for students unlikely to sit through the whole class: argue for your strongest point first, so those who check out after getting "the general idea" get an idea that they're likely to be able to use.
-->

### Option 2

<!--
Explain another possibility.
-->

### Option 3

<!--
Explain another possibility.
-->

### Analysis

<!--
If understanding how to choose well among options requires some in-depth explanation or background information, provide it here.

Link to a numbered reference like [(1)](#resources) if that helps you incorporate an authoritative statement or some other external evidence.

Link to another article in this collection like [Introduction to container technologies: orchestration and management of container clusters](/container-technologies-orchestration-clusters/) if that helps you suggest that we have a related, deeper explanation (learn by reading) or a relevant tutorial (learn by doing) nearby.

Link to a named source like [RFC1918 Address Allocation for Private Internets](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) if that helps you use industry-standard concepts without stopping to explain them.

Whatever you link to, mention it in Resources.
-->

### Comparison and recommendations

<!--
Communicate comparisons with more than words: draw a chart; make a table; find a visually-obvious way of *showing* how options differ.

End the section by directly recommending one option, if that's possible:

**Current Recommendation:** Kubernetes

### Resources

<!--
Set the <a name="resources"></a> anchor above the Resources section heading so links come to the top of the section.

If a reference is cited by a number in the text such as [(1)](#resources), include it in a numbered list here.

If the text links to or hints at another source beneficial to readers, include it in a bulleted list here.

Conclude with general suggestions about other doc we provide, encouraging readers to read on.

Carina documentation includes *tutorials* and *references*:

* For detailed information about how to solve specific issues or work with specific architectures,
  explore the *references* collection.
* For discussions of key ideas, recommendations of useful methods and tools, and
  general good advice, explore the *best-practices* collection.
