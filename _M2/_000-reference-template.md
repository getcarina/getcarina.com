<!--
Use reference articles to explain error messages, provide troubleshooting information, and provide other information that is not tutorial or conceptual in nature. For example, you might describe a series of commands or command options, or provide a list of definitions (such as a glossary). Use a noun or gerund to begin titles. For example:

# Error running interactive Docker shell on Windows
# Troubleshooting the Docker Toolbox setup on Windows 7, 8.1, and 10
-->

Introductory paragraph

<!--
Provide a descriptive introduction for the article. If it is a troubleshooting article, describe the issue or error. If it is a reference article, describe what kind of information the article provides. For example:

"This article provides solutions for some of the issues that can occur when you download and set up Docker Toolbox on Windows versions 7, 8.1, and 10."

"When you try to run a Docker container that is published to a specific port, as shown in the following example, it does not start and the following error message is displayed:"

### Section heading

<!--
Divide the content into sections as needed, and provide descriptive headings for each section. For example, if there are several subsets of commands to describe, describe them in separate sections. If there are two or more ways to resolve an issue, describe each in a subsection.

Do not create only one heading in the article. Create two or more, or none.

If you need to include steps for resolving an issue, do so by using a numbered list.
