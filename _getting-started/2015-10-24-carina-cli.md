This tutorial demonstrates how to install and configure the Carina client so that you can use it to launch and control Carina clusters from the command line. No prior knowledge of containers, Docker or Kubernetes is necessary.

**Note**: This guide uses the command-line interface to create a cluster. To use the graphical user interface, see [Getting started on Carina]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/getting-started-on-carina/).

### Sign up for Carina

To run applications on Carina, create a free account (no credit card required) by following the [sign up process](https://app.getcarina.com/app/signup).

Note your Carina API key. To get it, go to the [Carina Control Panel](https://app.getcarina.com), click your username in the top-right corner, and then click **API Key**.

### Download and install the CLI

To download and install the `carina` CLI, use the appropriate instructions for your operating system.

Open an application in which to run commands.

* On Linux and Mac OS X, open a terminal.
* On Windows, open PowerShell.

#### OS X with Homebrew

If you're using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), run the following commands:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carina
```

#### Linux and OS X without Homebrew

Downloads for the [latest release](https://github.com/getcarina/carina/releases/latest) of `carina` are available for Linux and OS X. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
$ curl -L https://download.getcarina.com/carina/latest/$(uname -s)/$(uname -m)/carina -o carina
$ mv carina ~/bin/carina
$ chmod u+x ~/bin/carina
```

#### Windows with Chocolatey

If you are using [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/), run the following command:

```powershell
> choco install carina
```

#### Windows without Chocolatey

Downloads for the [latest release](https://github.com/getcarina/carina/releases/latest) of `carina` are available for Windows. Open PowerShell and run the following command:

```powershell
> wget 'https://download.getcarina.com/carina/latest/Windows/x86_64/carina.exe' -OutFile carina.exe
```

Now move `carina.exe` to a directory on your `%PATH%`.

### Configure with Carina credentials

1. Gather the required information:
  * Username (CARINA_USERNAME): Your Carina username from the [Carina Control Panel](https://app.getcarina.com), displayed at the top right. In many cases, your username is your email address.
  * API key (CARINA_APIKEY): Your Carina API key. To find it, see [Sign up for Carina](#sign-up-for-carina).

2. Set your environment variables to contain these credentials. Replace `<username>` with your Carina username and `<apikey>` with your Carina password.

    On Linux and Mac OS X terminals, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    $ export CARINA_USERNAME=<username>
    $ export CARINA_APIKEY=<apikey>
    ```

    On Windows PowerShell, run the following commands:

    ```powershell
    > $env:CARINA_USERNAME="<username>"
    > $env:CARINA_APIKEY="<apikey>"
    ```

3. Verify that you can issue `carina` commands:

    ```bash
    $ carina clusters
    ID                                      Name        Status    Template    Nodes
    9f320718-e0b6-4687-9c43-0e0c39eba9e2    mycluster   active    swarm-dev   1
    ```

    The output is your list of clusters, if you already have some clusters already running.

### Create and connect to your cluster

1. Create a Docker Swarm cluster by using the `carina create` command.

    The `--wait` flag will wait for the cluster to become active before returning.

    ```bash
    $ carina create --wait --template swarm-dev mycluster
    ID                                      Name        Status    Template    Nodes
    9f320718-e0b6-4687-9c43-0e0c39eba9e2    mycluster   active    swarm-dev   1
    ```

1. Configure your shell to connect to your cluster.

    On Linux and Mac OS X terminals, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    $ eval $(carina env mycluster)
    ```

    On Windows PowerShell, run the following commands:

    ```powershell
    > carina env mycluster --shell powershell  | iex
    ```
