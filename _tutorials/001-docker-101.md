Maybe you've seen whales floating all around the Internet, or maybe you've heard everyone you know talking about containers and you're feeling left out.  Containers, and Docker specifically, are taking the DevOps world by storm, because they allow complex applications to be deployed and run in predictable, safe environments on just about any cloud platform.

**Containers** let you install software and run applications just like you would on a normal server, but instead of having multiple applications sharing the same server directly, each one is tucked away into a sandbox. This sandbox is achieved by using several features that are already built into the Linux kernel.

**Docker** provides a standard interface that makes building, running, and sharing containers relatively easy. Ironically, the most difficult part of using Docker is just getting it installed in the first place.
