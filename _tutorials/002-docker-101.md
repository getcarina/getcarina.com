#What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications
into containers <!--link to Containers 101-->. It's an easy-to-use tool that
allows that allows you to interact and run your code in a lightweight and fast
environment.

Using Docker offers several clear benefits:

* Docker uses LXC (Linux Containers), allowing for features such as cgroups and namespaces
  for process isolation. Because of this isolation, Docker containers take only seconds to launch.
  However, Docker isn't limited to LXC. As Docker is updated, it will
  be able to leverage other container technologies as well as LXC.

* Docker uses a copy-on-write file system, allowing the users to easily link containers
  to other containers. This encourages enterprise and service-oriented architectures. While
  each container still runs a single application or process, linking allows you to create a
  series on inter-connected containers, essentially layering one on to, making it very easy for you to distribute, scale,
  and triage your own applications.

* Docker ensures that your code environment and your deploy environment is consistent,
  reducing the risk of deployment issues.

#How does Docker work?

Docker is made up of these core components:

* The Docker client and daemon
* Docker Images
* Docker Containers

##Docker client and daemon
Docker uses RESTful API, as well as a command line client binary called `docker`.
These clients interact with the Docker daemon. The daemon acts like a server, except
it automates the processes that manage containers.

Both the client and the daemon can run on the same host, as seen in the diagram
below.

##Docker Images
Containers use images similar to how servers use images. They act as the base
for all of your containers. You can either uses images uploaded by other
users onto [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) or create your own images.

Besides sharing images, Docker Hub also allows you to store any images you have
created. You can choose to make these images public or keep them private.

In order to store or share images, you will need to create a free Docker Hub account.
You can sign-up for an account [here](https://hub.docker.com/).

##Docker Containers
The best way to understand containers is to think of a standard shipping container,
the one used on freight ships to take goods all over the world. While each shipping
container hold different goods inside, they are all loaded and shipped the exact same way.

Instead of goods, Docker Containers contains an image, a set of standard operations,
and an execution environment. The image is your operating environment (ie. Ubuntu).
A container can perform a set of standard operations, it can be created, started, or
destroyed. Lastly, the execution environment decides how the containers are deployed.

<!--diagram explaining Docker containers here-->

This is where Rackspace Container Services(RCS) comes in. Because Docker containers
are interchangeable, once an application is deployable with containers, a host is needed
in order to take your build from local to scalable. RCS takes your containers and
deploys them using the Rackspace Managed Cloud. Both of these services combined allow you
to deploy even though most complex architectures with ease.

#How to install Docker
