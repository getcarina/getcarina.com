###Install Docker with Mac OS X

This tutorial describes how to install and set up Docker on Mac OS X.

###Prerequisites
* A working Terminal application.
* A Mac running OS X version 10.8 (Mountain Lion) or later. Display the version by clicking the Apple icon the top-left of your screen, then selecting **About this Mac**.

###Install Docker

You install Docker on Mac OS X by installing Docker Toolbox. Docker Toolbox comes packaged with the following components:

* Kitematic, the GUI client for Docker
* Oracle VM VirtualBox
* The `docker` binary
* The `docker-machine` binary, which helps create Docker hosts

Follow these steps to install Docker:

1. Go to the [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/toolbox) page.

2. Click **Download (Mac)** to download the toolbox.

3. Double-click the installer file.

4. On the welcome page, click **Continue**, and follow the instructions until you get to the Installation Type page.

   The installer gives you the option to customize your installation. However, we recommend keeping the defaults.

5. Ensure that every component is selected and then click **Install**.

   ![Make sure all boxes are selected](/_assets/img/002-docker-101/mac-toolbox-install-type.png)

   By default, the binaries are installed to `/usr/local/bin`.

   After the installation is completed, the installer provides you with shortcuts, which you can ignore.

   ![The installer will provide you with shortcuts. Ignore these and click continue.](/_assets/img/002-docker-101/mac-toolbox-install-apps.png)

6. Click **Continue**

7. After the installer has confirmed that the installation was successful, click **Close**.

###Set up Docker (Mac OS X)

To run a Docker container, you must create a new Docker virtual machine (VM) and switch to the VM's environment. From that environment, you can use the `docker` client to manage your containers.

1. Open Launchpad and click the Docker Quickstart Terminal icon.

   A terminal window opens and sets up Docker for you. Successful output should look as follows:

   ```

             \    \         __/
              \____\_______/


   The Docker Quick Start Terminal is configured to use Docker with the “default” VM.
   ```

2. In terminal, type the command `docker run hello-world`. You should receive the following output:

   ```
   bash-3.2$ docker run hello-world

   Hello from Docker.
   This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

   To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
   1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
   2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
   3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
   4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

   To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
   $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

   Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker Hub account:
   https://hub.docker.com

   For more examples and ideas, visit:
   https://docs.docker.com/userguide/`
   ```

If you received preceding output, Docker is up and running.

**Note:** If the `hello-world` image is not already on your local system, the Docker
client might take up to a minute to pull the image from Docker Hub. If this occurs, you will
receive this output when you enter `docker run hello-world`.

```
bash-3.2$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
