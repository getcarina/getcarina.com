**Docker support for Windows** 

You can now use the Docker client directly from a Windows computer to manage containers that are running on Linux hosts.

In a Docker installation on Linux, your computer functions both as the localhost and the Docker host. In networking, localhost means your computer. The Docker host represents the computer on which the containers run.

On a typical Linux installation, the Docker client, the Docker daemon, and any containers run directly on your localhost. This means you can address ports on a Docker container using standard localhost addressing such as localhost:8000 or 0.0.0.0:8376.

In an Windows installation, the docker daemon is running inside a Linux virtual machine. You use the Windows Docker client to talk to the Docker host VM. Your Docker containers run inside this host.

In Windows, the Docker host address is the address of the Linux VM. When you start the VM with docker-machine it is assigned an IP address. When you start a container, the ports on a container map to ports on the VM. To see this in practice, work through the exercises on this page.

 
 **System Requirements** 
 
Your machine must be running on of the following Windows operating systems to run Docker:

* Windows 7.1
* 8/8.1

**Note** Windows 10 is not currently supported.

**Important** Make sure your Windows system supports Hardware Virtualization Technology and that virtualization is enabled. For Windows 7, run the MicrosoftÂ® Hardware-Assisted Virtualization Detection Tool and follow the on-screen instructions.
