Docker now supports running the Docker Toolbox on Windows systems. You can use a Docker client directly from your Windows machine to manage containers running on Linux hosts.

#Prerequisites
To run Docker on Windows, your system must be running Windows 7.1, 8/8.1 or newer to run Docker Toolbox. 

Make sure your Windows system supports **Hardware Virtualization Technology** and that virtualization is enabled. 

####For Windows 8 or Windows 8.1

1. Choose **Start** > **Task Manager** and navigate to the Performance tab. In **Task Manager**, under **CPU**, you should see Virtualization: Enabled (add screenshot here).
2. If virtualization is not enabled on your system, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for enabling it.

####For Windows 7

Run the [Microsoft® Hardware-Assisted Virtualization Detection Tool] (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=592) and follow the on-screen instructions.
